# backup.sh

## description
creates a 'hardlink-based' backup set with 10 of each of the four supported time interval types (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly). the use of hardlinks means the disk space footprint for the incremental sets is kept to a minimum - **there is no duplication of identical** files, which is in essence its sole raison d'Ãªtre

## usage
```
SYNTAX: backup_ [OPTIONS]

where [OPTIONS] can be:

  -s, --sources <SOURCES>  : file containing source paths to backup,
                             one per line
                             (default: 'BACKUP_ROOT/.include')
  -i, --intervals <INTERVALS>  : space-delimited list of supported
                                 interval types (default: 'hourly daily
                                 weekly monthly')
  -t, --type <TYPE>  : initiate backup from TYPE interval, where TYPE
                       is a member of the INTERVALS set
                       (default: 'hourly')
  -f, --force  : force backup regardless of whether the interval type's
                 epoch has elapsed since its previous update. this
                 will thus always roll the backup set along one
  -nc, --no-cascade  : update only the specified interval type's set
  -r, --root  : specify the root of the backup set
  -v, --verbose  : verbose mode
  -h, --help  : this help info

environment variables:

  BACKUP_ROOT  : as detailed above
  RSYNC  : path to the rsync binary to use (default: auto)
  RSYNC_OPTIONS  : space delimited set of options to pass to rsync.
                   modifying this is very dangerous and may compromise
                   your backup set
                   (default: --archive --relative --delete --verbose)
```

## implementation
if a backup program is defined simply as a file copier on a schedule, then this script should be viewed as a relatively thin wrapper over the **rsync** file copier which expects to be called via a scheduler like **cron**, or integrated into the likes of **systemd** via a timer, in order to operate as intended. the extremely impressive *rsync*, is very mature and as such very unlikely to cause problems at the business end of this wrapper (the actual file copying).

this wrapper uses the *rsync* binary to firstly construct a *master* backup set of all required files, from which it then, providing a specific requested interval (or any interval representing a greater epoch when 'cascading' - which happens by default) has fully elapsed, a further *rsync* backup set is made for that interval type. importantly this time however, the backup is 'hardlink-based'. just prior to this hardlink-backup type, the set is 'rolled'. there are 10 backups in each interval type's set

by way of example: if running concurrent hourly backups, then after 11 hours of use, the `hourly.10` folder, which will necessarily exist, will be removed, and all preceding folders in the set will then be rolled/'pushed back' (`hourly.1` -> `hourly.2` etc.) to make way for the latest backup set (`hourly.1`). the backup set with the closest state to that purged (`hourly.10`) would then be found in one of the backups for an interval type with greater time epoch, i.e `daily.1` in this instance*

the implementation requires a list of source directories in the *rsync* format. this allows for partial relative directory structures to be specified, e.g:
```
source              target
/root/./docs/       TARGET/docs
/var/./www/docs/    TARGET/www/docs
```

*\*note: this is not guaranteed to be in a sensible location (as given by the example) where use of the `--force` switch has been made on the backup set. forcing a backup for a given interval type breaks the minimal time epoch separation between backups in that set, thus potentially making it more difficult to find a specific version*

## rsync parameter reference

**default** / current options in use
```
-v, --verbose   : increase verbosity
--delete        : delete extraneous files from dest dirs
-R, --relative  : use relative path names
-a, --archive   : archive mode; equals -rlptgoD
which translates to:
  -r, --recursive  : implied by -a
  -l, --links      : copy symlinks as symlinks
  -p, --perms      : preserve permissions
  -t, --times      : preserve modification times
  -g, --group      : preserve group
  -o, --owner      : preserve owner (super-user only)
  -D               : same as --devices --specials
  which translates to:
    --devices   : preserve device files (super-user only)
    --specials  : preserve special files
```
miscellaneous, **non-default** options
```
-u, --update           : skip files that are newer on the receiver
-E, --executability    : preserve the file's executability
-X, --xattrs           : preserve extended attributes
-n, --dry-run          : don't actually copy/move/delete any files
--files-from=FILE      : read a list of source-file names from FILE
--no-R, --no-relative  : the relative path part of the source directory
```
**note**:
`--files-from=FILE`  is used to subset the source(s). be aware of the
implicit behavioural changes that this option will cause to others,
e.g. archive mode where, `--relative` and `--no-recursive` are then
implied, and as such additional `--no-relative` and `--recursive`
options would be needed to restore archive mode's usual characteristics.
